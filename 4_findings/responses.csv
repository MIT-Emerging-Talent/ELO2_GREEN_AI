Some open-source models have a huge number of parameters, ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion. Additionally, you should consider Quantization and Precision,( the data type used for weights in the model). For example, using a data type like FP16 (16-bit floating-point) requires more VRAM.

There are many other factors that affect the usability of a model, such as the Maximum Context Window, tokenizers, and Training Datasets. In my opinion, the Training Datasets are one of the most important factors.

I believe open-source LLMs can be used for more specific and personal tasks and applications. As computing technology continues to improve and become more affordable, I believe that commercial LLMs will become less relevant for daily usage. However, for specialized, complex tasks and professional applications, commercial models will likely remain in demand for a long time. "

i guess commercial ones are designed to satisfy us while open-source ones are suiting to prompt and chatting with us which is something i prefer.","Mostly yes, with minor differences","It's hard to have an opinion about open-source models ability to perform various tasks since they are not full capable of what mainstream commercial agents can do as extra like creating video, photo editing, helping you to learn something with extra tools, etc. For those jobs to be done with open-source models you should have like 2-3 models that concentrated in one area of a certain task since there isn't a open-source model that including everything with one model.

As for text-based prompts and outputs though, i can say that most of the open-source models are on par with commercial ones but the real difference is probably lies within the users personal preference.
except for low parameter Meta-made Llama models. They tend to give short answers excessively i think.
