# Final Presentation

🟩 Design Explanation

- We designed the presentation using a green color theme to reflect our focus on
environmental cost awareness while testing the potential of open-source AI models.

- The road-based layout was chosen intentionally it guides the audience through
our journey step by step, showing where we encountered challenges, how we pivoted
from those obstacles, and where we ultimately arrived by the end of the project.
This design visually represents both our commitment to sustainability and the
path we took to complete the work.
