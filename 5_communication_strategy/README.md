# Communication Strategy

📄 Why We Chose an Article as Our Communication Artifact

For this project, we selected an article as our primary communication artifact because
 it allowed us to clearly and meaningfully share the full story of our journey both
  the technical and Thinking sides of it.

An article gave us the space to explain:

- Why we started this project and what motivated us to pursue it

- The challenges we encountered, including the obstacles that slowed us down or
 changed our direction

- How we addressed these challenges, detailing the steps, decisions, and problem-solving
 approaches we used

- What we ultimately achieved, highlighting the key results and insights gained

- The future work that is still needed, so others can build on what we started

We chose this format because it is accessible, reflective, and allows readers to
follow our thought process from beginning to end. More importantly, an article
helps us communicate not only what we built, but why it mattered and how the
experience shaped our learning.
