# Milestone 4 Meeting Minutes

## Meeting 18

**Date:** November 19, 2025 (Wednesday, 1:00 PM EST)  
**Attendees:** Amro, Aseel, Banu, Caesar, Reem, Safia  

### Summary

- The research question was refined with Evan's help:  
  - During the group conversation with Evan on Slack, team initially drafted a
    precise question focusing on whether optimized open-source models (e.g., via
    recursive editing, distillation) could become environmentally and
    functionally viable alternatives to commercial models.  
  - However, Evan advised that the ELO2 project should remain **open-ended**,
    shifting toward a broader guiding question:  
    **“How can we achieve similar results to large private models on smaller
    devices and with less power consumption?”**  
  - As a result, the final deliverable will be a **comprehensive portfolio** of
    experiments, benchmarks, comparisons, and promising directions—rather than a
    single definitive answer.  
- Based on Evan’s feedback, the upcoming **Google Form** will include both
   **commercial** and **open-source** model responses.  
- Initially, the plan was to pair small open-source SLMs with commercial models
  of similar sizes, but this was not feasible due to limited access. The team
  instead decided to **use accessible commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude,
  Gemini).**  
- **All questions** across all categories will be used in the **Google form**.  
- Finalized model assignments:  
  - **Aseel** → ChatGPT  
  - **Caesar** → Claude Haiku 4.5  
  - **Amro** → Gemini Pro 3  
  - **Banu** → Gemini Fast (Flash 2.5)  
  - **Reem** → Gemini Flash 2.5 Lite (via API/HuggingFace)  

### Action Plan

- Each member will generate **responses for all question prompts** using their
  assigned model.  
- All responses must be uploaded to the
  [shared document](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CBYpsLvkeE5aLKp1-6vPaiiz>
  DXVf80o2uH42XL5gXtw/edit?tab=t.0) **by tomorrow**.  
- In tomorrow’s meeting, the team will review all open-source and commercial
  model outputs and **select the final answers** to include in the Google Form.

## Meeting 19

**Date:** November 20, 2025 (Thursday, 2:30 PM EST)  
**Attendees:** Amro, Aseel, Caesar, Reem, Safia  

### Summary

- The team revisited the original plan for the evaluation form. Initially,
  **all 21 questions** across all task categories were intended to be included.
- However, because a 21-question survey would be too long for participants, the
  group agreed to **select only two questions per category** to keep the form
  manageable.  
- During this selection process, the team decided to **exclude the
  Retrieval/RAG category** entirely, since its questions require factual lookup
  (dates, names, quantities), which does not align well with the survey’s goal
  of evaluating reasoning or generation quality.  
- As a result, the form will include **four categories**—Reasoning,
  Summarization, Creative Writing, Paraphrasing—with **two questions per
  category**, for a total of **8 questions**.  
  _(Selected Q&A's can be found
  [here.](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CBYpsLvkeE5aLKp1-6vPaiizDXVf80o2uH>
  42XL5gXtw/edit?tab=t.ugqqnecewdh7))_
- The group reaffirmed that **each task category will be represented by one
  model pair**, ensuring all models contribute to the study.  
- The team decided to **pair each open-source model with the closest commercial
  model** for comparative evaluation.  
- The final task–model pairings were confirmed as:  
  - **Reasoning:** Gemma ↔ Claude Haiku 4.5  
  - **Summarization:** LaMini ↔ Gemini Flash  
  - **Creative Writing:** Mistral ↔ Gemini Pro 3  
  - **Paraphrasing:** Qwen ↔ ChatGPT  

### Action Plan

- Add the selected model responses to the **Google Form** initially created by
  Banu and finalize the form.  
- Submit the form to **Evan** for feedback, then incorporate any revisions.  
- **Publish** the finalized form to the cohort group and **collect responses
  until November 30**.

## Meeting 20  

**Date:** November 25, 2025 (Tuesday, 2:30 PM EST)  
**Attendees:** Amro, Caesar, Reem, Banu  

### Summary

- To discuss what is left while the form is still running, the team reviewed the
  remaining deliverables for both **ELO2/Graduation requirements** and **the
  project itself**.

   1. For **ELO2 and graduation**, the deliverables were revisited and confirmed
      as:  
       - Repository  
       - Presentation  
       - 1000-word final testimonial  _(individual)_  
       - 1000-word ELO2 retrospective  _(individual)_  
       - Exit Survey _(individual)_

   2. For **Green AI project’s final outputs**, the deliverables were identified
      as:  
       - Repository  
       - Article  
       - Presentation  
       - Form analysis  
- The team also discussed the expected article format and structure.  
  - The article should narrate the project process by explaining motivations and
     the overall journey, with roughly **5–10%** on initial ideas, most of the
     content focusing on the work done, and a concluding section with findings
     and potential future directions.
- Reem volunteered to create an infographic or visual summary that can be used
  for both the article and the presentation.
- It was also noted that **on November 28 (Friday)**, support may be requested
  from Evan to help boost form participation through an announcement.  
- Since the form was published later than anticipated, the team decided to
  **close it on December 2nd instead of November 30th.**

### Action Plan

- **Caesar and Reem** to begin drafting the article for team review.  
- **Amro** to work on repository updates and refine the main README draft
  prepared by Banu earlier.  
- **Reem** to create an infographic using a **visualization tool** to summarize
  project results for the article, presentation, and Medium or similar platforms
  _(after the form closes)_.  
- The survey form will be **closed on December 2nd**, after which data analysis
  will begin.  
- **Banu, Safia, and Aseel** to work on the presentation, building on the
  initial draft previously prepared by Banu.  
- An announcement request **may be sent to Evan on November 28 (Friday)** to
  encourage more form responses.

## Meeting 21  

**Date:** December 2, 2025 (Tuesday, 12:30 PM EST)  
**Attendees:** Caesar, Reem, Aseel

### Summary

- The team discussed the status of the survey form and agreed to close it by the
  end of the day. After reviewing its current performance, they noted that most
  initial insights and demographics could already be observed through the Google
  Forms visualization tools, which provided a general overview of respondent
  characteristics and early trends.
- The group revisited the remaining requirements and clarified what still needs
  to be completed for the final deliverables. A key part of the discussion
  focused on how the results will be structured and presented in both the
  article and the visual summary. This included considering how to best
  translate the survey findings into a clear narrative and an accompanying
  infographic or visualization.
- The team confirmed that an additional meeting would be held on December 3rd to
  examine the survey results in more depth. During that session, they will
  identify any notable or unexpected findings that may require special emphasis
  or separate formats within the final outputs.

### Action Plan

- Close the survey form by end of day on December 2.  
- Begin outlining how survey results will be integrated into the article and
  visual materials.  
- Continue exploring the data using Google Forms visualizations to prepare for
  deeper analysis.  
- Meet again on December 3rd to review detailed results and determine standout
  findings or sections that require special formatting.
