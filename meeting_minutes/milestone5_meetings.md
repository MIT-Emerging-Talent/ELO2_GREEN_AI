# Milestone 5 Meeting Minutes

## Meeting 22

**Date:** December 4, 2025 (Thursday, 1:00 PM EST)  
**Attendees:** Amro, Aseel, Banu, Caesar, Safia  

### Summary

- The team reviewed the overall project status, noting that only a few days remained
  and both the **presentation** and the **article** were close to completion.  
- The group discussed the structure of the final presentation, agreeing on a
  **category-based layout** (reasoning, summarization, creative generation, paraphrasing)
  supported by charts, visuals, and short explanations.  
- Aseel led the design direction, and the team confirmed a **road-themed visual style**
  for consistency across slides.  
- The group highlighted key research findings:  
  - Open-source models performed surprisingly well in **reasoning** and
  **creative generation** tasks.  
  - Commercial LLMs still hold advantages for **highly specialized or complex domains**.
  - Promising future directions include experimenting with larger parameter counts,
  fine-tuning methods, and evaluating performance under different context window
  sizes.

### Action Plan

- **Banu** will compile and document all experiment findings (questions, answers,
  charts) and upload the file to the GitHub repo, to the **'findings' folder**.
- **Caesar** will continue to work on the **article and 'experiment' folder** of
  the repo.
- **Amro** will finalize the **main README**.
- **Aseel** will continue leading the presentation design and **finalize the slides**.
- **Reem** will complete the **visual summaries** for the article and presentation.
