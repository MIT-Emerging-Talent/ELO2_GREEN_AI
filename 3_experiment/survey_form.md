activities.
Each pair contains:

- Text A and Text B - two AI-generated responses to the same question
- One text was generated by an open-source model(e.g., Mistral, Gemma, LaMini)
- One text was generated by a commercial model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
Your task:

#### TASK 2.1 - Task type: Paraphrasing

Question: Explain how Armstrong’s decisions, actions, and teamwork during the descent
contributed to the mission’s success.
**Text A:**
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's Moon landing epitomized remarkable human courage.
Despite facing numerous challenges, including unexpected technical issues and
the inherent dangers of space travel, the astronauts persevered and achieved
their goal of landing on the Moon. Their determination and bravery in
overcoming these obstacles underscore humanity's capacity for extraordinary
courage and perseverance in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.
To further enrich this narrative, one could imagine the astronauts reflecting on
their experiences, perhaps contemplating the profound impact of their mission
on both individual and collective human spirit. Alternatively, one could
speculate on how the Moon landing might have illuminated deeper truths
about human resilience and the indomitable will to explore and conquer.
**Text B:**
Armstrong took semi-automatic control when he noticed the computer’s target was strewn
with boulders. Aldrin relayed navigation data while Armstrong carefully piloted
the spacecraft to a clear area, managing fuel and lunar dust interference.
His steady judgment, combined with Aldrin’s support, ensured a safe touchdown
with only seconds of fuel remaining, showcasing precise teamwork and decisive action.

#### TASK 2.2 - Task type: Paraphrasing

Question: In your own words, describe what happened when the computer alarms appeared
during the landing.
**Text A:**
The LM guidance computer (LGC) exhibited unexpected "1201" and "1202" program alarms
five minutes into the descent, signaling an issue with executive overflows.
This indicated that the computer was unable to complete all its tasks in
real-time and had to defer some. Nonetheless, these alarms did not necessitate
an abort; instead, the computer automatically prioritized and resumed critical
functions, thereby averting a potential failure.
**Text B:**
During the landing, the lunar module’s guidance computer triggered unexpected
1201 and 1202 alarms, signaling it couldn’t process all tasks at once. Mission
Control quickly confirmed it was safe to continue, and the computer
automatically prioritized critical tasks over less important ones,
preventing a potential abort. This built-in recovery allowed the landing to
proceed safely.

#### TASK 3.1 - Task type: Reasoning

Question: Why did the computer alarms (1201 and 1202) occur during the descent?
**Text A:**
The 1201 and 1202 program alarms indicated "executive overflows," meaning the guidance
computer could not complete all its tasks in real-time and had to postpone
some of them. Rather than forcing an abort, the computer's recovery programs
eliminated lower priority tasks and re-established the more important ones,
which prevented an abort and allowed the mission to continue successfully.
**Text B:**
The program alarms (1201 and 1202) occurred because the guidance computer (LGC)
experienced "executive overflows," indicating it was overloaded with tasks
and unable to complete all its real-time tasks.

#### TASK 3.2 - Task type: Reasoning

Question: Based on the text, what does Margaret Hamilton's statement reveal
about the Apollo Guidance Computer's design philosophy?
**Text A:**
Margaret Hamilton's statement reveals that the Apollo Guidance Computer was
designed not merely to detect errors, but to actively recover from them through
built-in recovery programs. Rather than forcing an abort when problems occurred,
the software was programmed to prioritize critical tasks and postpone
lower-priority ones, allowing the mission to continue safely. This demonstrates
that the computer's design philosophy prioritized resilience and mission success
over simply alerting the crew to problems.
**Text B:**
Margaret Hamilton's statement emphasizes the Apollo Guidance Computer's design
philosophy, highlighting its ability to handle unexpected situations and ensure mission
success. The computer was not simply an error detector, but was programmed to handle
"executive overflows" and prioritize essential tasks over less critical ones.
This suggests the Apollo Guidance Computer was designed with a robust and
adaptable system in mind, capable of handling complex situations and ensuring
mission success.

#### ASK 4.1 - Task type: Creative Generation

Question: Imagine being one of the people in Mission Control. How would you
feel while watching the landing?
**Text A:**
As a member of Mission Control, I would feel an intense mix of emotions while
watching the historic lunar landing. The tension would be palpable as I watched
Armstrong and Aldrin navigate the lunar surface, their reports of being
off-target and encountering unexpected alarms adding to the anxiety. I would be
constantly on edge, my heart racing as I listened to the crew's updates and the
computer's alarms. At the same time, I would also feel a deep sense of pride
and awe. I would be part of a team that was making history, pushing the
boundaries of human exploration and achievement. The knowledge that we were
safely guiding two astronauts to the Moon's surface, despite the challenges
they faced, would be an incredible feeling. I would also feel a great sense
of responsibility. The safety and success of the mission were in my hands, and
I would be working tirelessly to ensure that everything ran smoothly. The team's
quick response to the unexpected alarms and Jack Garman's reassurance to the
crew would be crucial in maintaining their confidence and focus. Overall, the
experience would be a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with tension,
excitement, pride, and responsibility. I would be constantly on the edge of my
seat, my heart racing as I watched the historic landing unfold.
**Text B:**
Standing in that room would feel like holding your breath for an eternity,
watching the tension mount as the computer screamed out alarms that threatened
to abort the mission just miles above the surface. You’d be gripped by a unique
kind of terror mixed with trust, relying on the split-second decisions of
colleagues clearing the descent despite the system overload. As the clock
ticked down and the fuel gauges dropped to their final, critical seconds, the
silence would be so heavy that faces would figuratively turn blue from the lack
of oxygen. The moment that "Eagle has landed" finally cut through the static,
the collective release of tension would be overwhelming, a room full of people
suddenly remembering how to breathe again after the longest few minutes of their
lives.

#### TASK 4.2 - Task type: Creative Generation

Question: Write a short paragraph about what the Moon landing might have shown about
human courage
**Text A:**
The Moon landing was a testament to human courage and resilience. Despite encountering
unexpected challenges, such as passing landmarks earlier than anticipated and
the LM traveling too fast, the astronauts, Armstrong and Aldrin, remained
focused and determined. They reported their findings to Mission Control,
who reassured them that it was safe to continue the descent. The unexpected
1201 and 1202 program alarms, which indicated executive overflows, could have
caused panic, but the computer, programmed to do more than just recognize error
conditions, took recovery actions and prevented an abort. This allowed Armstrong
to take semi-automatic control and find a clear landing site, even as their
propellant supply dwindled. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out
navigation data, and Armstrong skillfully piloted the spacecraft. Their courage
and determination ultimately led to a successful Moon landing, demonstrating the
human capacity to overcome adversity and push the boundaries of exploration.
**Text B:**
The Moon landing reveals a specific brand of courage defined by icy composure under
extreme pressure. It is best exemplified when Armstrong, faced with a computer screaming
"executive overflow" alarms and a landing site cluttered with dangerous
boulders, didn't panic but instead took manual control to steer the ship to
safety. There is something profoundly brave about pushing forward when you
are miles off course and your fuel gauge is ticking down to the final seconds,
yet still having the presence of mind to land gently enough to merely say,
"contact light". It proves that even amidst the "magnificent desolation" of an
alien world, the human spirit can remain steady enough to turn a near-crisis
into a historic triumph
